  Adequate care is necessary to choose a suitable Group. The selection of a particular Group largely depends on the subscriber's capacity to provide surplus funds month after month from his normal income for this purpose.

            It is a CONTRACT between the foreman, as the Promoter is called, and the subscribers, who join voluntarily. It is a FINANCIAL SYSTEM under which the periodical and regular savings of a group of subscribers are made available to each subscriber, a SPECIFIED AMOUNT every month (installment) for a SPECIFIED PERIOD.


The Pooled funds every month are offered to the subscribers at monthly AUCTIONS and the subscriber who BIDS for the highest DISCOUNT is declared the PRIZE WINNER and given the PRIZE AMOUNT on proper security. A Prized subscriber also should continue to pay the subscriptions till the termination of the chit. The  amount foregone as a discount, less foreman's commission is distributed among the subscribers as dividend
